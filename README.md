# 📰 Fake News Detection System

## Live App Preview

![Fake News App Screenshot](app_screenshot.png)

A Machine Learning based web application that detects whether a news article is **Fake** or **Real** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

This project demonstrates end-to-end ML workflow including data preprocessing, model comparison, evaluation, and deployment using Streamlit.

## 📌 Project Overview

Fake news detection is a critical problem in today's digital world.  
This project uses **TF-IDF vectorization** and **Support Vector Machine (LinearSVC)** to classify news articles based on learned linguistic patterns.

The system was trained on a labeled dataset of real and fake news articles and deployed as a web application.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Pipeline

<<<<<<< HEAD
- Total Samples: **44,898**
- Columns: `text`, `label`
- Label:
  - `0` → Fake News
  - `1` → Real News

The dataset was preprocessed and combined into a single CSV file before training.
=======
1. Data Loading & Cleaning  
2. Text Preprocessing  
3. Train-Test Split  
4. TF-IDF Feature Extraction  
5. Model Training:
   - Multinomial Naive Bayes
   - Logistic Regression
   - LinearSVC (Best Performing Model)
6. Model Evaluation:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1-Score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Cross-Validation
7. Model Saving using Joblib  
8. Deployment using Streamlit

## 📊 Model Performance

The **LinearSVC** model achieved strong performance with:

- High Accuracy (~99%)
- Balanced Precision and Recall
- Stable Cross-Validation scores
- Improved generalization using `class_weight='balanced'`

Cross-validation was used to ensure the model does not overfit and performs consistently across different data splits.

## 💡 How It Works

- The input news text is converted into numerical features using TF-IDF.
- The trained LinearSVC model predicts whether the article is Fake or Real.
- The decision function score is used to estimate prediction confidence.
- The result is displayed through a clean web interface.

## ⚠️ Important Note

This model detects writing style and linguistic patterns learned from the dataset.  
It does **not verify factual correctness** using external knowledge sources.

Short or out-of-distribution text may lead to biased predictions due to dataset limitations.
